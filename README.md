# RandomForests

In this project, we will be using a dataset containing census information from UCI’s Machine Learning Repository.

By using this census data with a random forest, we will try to predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000.

Let’s get started!

Project executed based on a request from Codecademy's Machine learning/AI development certification course.
